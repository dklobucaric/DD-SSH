# DD-SSH Known Limitations

**Checkpoint:** dev 0.1.5.0 — Andromeda

This document lists limitations that should be visible to testers. Nothing here is hidden or sugar-coated.

---

## Security limitations

- Saved passwords may be stored in plaintext in `dd-ssh.json`.
- Saved private keys may be stored in plaintext in `dd-ssh.json`.
- There is no master password yet.
- There is no encrypted secrets store yet.
- There is no SSH agent integration yet.
- Use only on trusted machines.

---

## Platform limitations

- Linux is the primary tested platform.
- Windows builds are planned but not fully validated.
- macOS builds are planned but not fully validated.
- Packaging/installers are not ready.
- Code signing/notarization is not ready.

---

## Feature limitations

Not implemented yet:

- SFTP
- Split panes
- Multi-Exec
- Keep-alive settings
- Portable mode next to binary
- Custom config path picker
- Encrypted config migration
- Advanced theme editor
- Terminal theme editor

---

## Terminal limitations

The xterm.js terminal foundation is working, including PTY resize and several fullscreen terminal apps. Still, testers should report issues with:

- unusual key combinations
- function keys
- alternate keyboard layouts
- tmux/screen edge cases
- terminal resize edge cases
- copy/paste edge cases

---

## Config limitations

Config import/export and recovery are implemented, but testers should handle real configs carefully because the file may contain plaintext secrets.

Always keep backups before testing import/export/recovery behavior.
