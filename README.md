# DD-SSH

**DD-SSH** is a clean cross-platform SSH client and session manager.

The goal is to build a lightweight SSH tool for Linux, Windows, and macOS with:

- SSH terminal
- Session manager
- Password and private-key authentication
- Tabs
- Copy/paste
- Single JSON config
- Export/import
- Sync-friendly config
- Keep-alive
- Known-host handling
- Multi-exec command

Early versions intentionally do **not** include SFTP, split-screen, cloud accounts, telemetry, or AI features inside the app.

## Project status

Development checkpoint: `dev 0.1.2.1`.

Current working foundation:

- Qt GUI skeleton with sidebar, tabs, toolbar, and About dialog
- Manual SSH connection dialog
- libssh handshake and password/private-key authentication tests
- known-host trust flow stored in `dd-ssh.json`
- Saved sessions loaded from `dd-ssh.json` into the sidebar
- Portable plaintext `secrets.mode = "plain-v1"` for early v1.0.x development
- Connect/auth test from saved sessions
- Delete saved sessions while preserving known-host trust records
- Edit saved sessions while keeping or replacing the saved plaintext secret
- Duplicate target warning when saving `username@host:port` that already exists
- Experimental basic saved-session SSH shell channel from the sidebar context menu

Saved session management is a real DD-SSH feature direction, not just a test helper. The long-term goal is full session CRUD: create/save, load/connect, edit/update, delete, and later import/export from one portable JSON file.

## Technology direction

- C++
- Qt 6
- CMake
- libssh
- xterm.js via Qt WebEngine for early terminal frontend
- JSON config

## Current shell limitation

`dev 0.1.2.0` added an experimental basic shell channel using libssh PTY + shell. `dev 0.1.2.1` cleans up that temporary tab before the xterm.js milestone: common ANSI escape sequences are hidden from the basic text view, the input field is clearer, and quick actions such as Send Ctrl+C and Clear output are available. It is **not** the final terminal emulator yet, so full-screen interactive programs like `htop`, `nano`, `vim`, `mc`, and `tmux` are not expected to behave correctly until the xterm.js terminal frontend is added.
