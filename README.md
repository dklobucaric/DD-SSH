# DD-SSH

**DD-SSH** is a clean cross-platform SSH client and session manager.

The goal is to build a lightweight SSH tool for Linux, Windows, and macOS with:

- SSH terminal
- Session manager
- Password and private-key authentication
- Tabs
- Copy/paste
- Single JSON config
- Export/import
- Sync-friendly config
- Keep-alive
- Known-host handling
- Multi-exec command

Early versions intentionally do **not** include SFTP, split-screen, cloud accounts, telemetry, or AI features inside the app.
